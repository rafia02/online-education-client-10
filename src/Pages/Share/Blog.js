                    <p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</p>

                    <p>Firebase concept is simple. When you build a client-side app with JavaScript or any of its frameworks, for instance, Google Firebase can turn this into a serverless app in no time. It also removes the need to manage databases yourself, as it does that for you.</p>

                    <p>The private route component is similar to the public route, the only change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition.
